# ðŸ¤– ChatBot Micro Frontend (MFE)

This is a React-based Micro Frontend (MFE) that exposes a `<ChatBot />` component via [Webpack 5 Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/). It can be consumed by any host application supporting Webpack Module Federation.

```


### You generally should declare shared dependencies in ModuleFederationPlugin if:

* You're using a library in both host and remote apps (like react, react-dom, react-router, etc.)

* You want to avoid multiple versions of the same library being loaded (which can break context-based libraries like React or Redux)

* The library has global state or singletons (like @reduxjs/toolkit, Zustand, or context providers)

### Tips
* Use singleton: true to ensure one shared instance across apps.
* Use eager: true sparingly â€“ it will bundle the dependency directly into remoteEntry.js.
* If you donâ€™t share a library that should be singleton (like react), it can lead to bugs such as:
State loss
* Inconsistent routing
* Hooks can only be called inside function components errors
* ðŸ§ª How to Know What to Share?
- Start simple: Just share react, react-dom, and context-based libraries.
- If a library causes issues in the host or remote runtime, try adding it to shared.
