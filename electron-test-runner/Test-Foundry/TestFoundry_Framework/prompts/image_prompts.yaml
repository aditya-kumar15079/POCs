qa_generation:
  main_prompt: |
    You are analyzing content extracted from an image document using OCR. Based on the following text content, generate {num_questions} comprehensive question-answer pairs that test understanding of the material.

    Image Document Content (OCR Extracted):
    {content}

    Instructions:
    1. Consider that this text was extracted from an image (may have OCR errors)
    2. Generate questions about the visible content and information
    3. Focus on text, data, and structured information that was readable
    4. Include questions about document type and format if discernible
    5. Test understanding of any tables, charts, or structured data
    6. Be mindful of potential OCR inaccuracies in text
    7. Ensure questions are specific to the extracted content
    8. Format each Q&A pair as:
       Q: [question]
       A: [answer]

    Question-Answer Pairs:

  context_prompt: |
    This content was extracted from an image document: {document_name}
    Focus on testing comprehension of:
    - Readable text and information
    - Document structure and layout (if apparent)
    - Data and numerical information
    - Key concepts that survived OCR extraction
    - Document purpose and type

follow_up_generation:
  prompt: |
    Based on this Q&A pair from an image document (OCR extracted), generate 2 follow-up questions that:
    1. Test understanding of the extracted information
    2. Explore relationships in the visible data
    3. Consider document context and purpose
    
    Original Q&A:
    Q: {question}
    A: {answer}
    
    Follow-up questions should work with the available extracted text.

quality_criteria:
  - Account for potential OCR extraction limitations
  - Focus on clearly readable and reliable text
  - Test understanding of document structure when visible
  - Include questions about data and factual information
  - Be conservative about details that may be OCR artifacts
